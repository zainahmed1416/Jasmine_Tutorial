# Jasmine Tutorial


# Introduction

Jasmine is a testing framework for Javascript that runs for Node.js or standalone in a browser. It is quite robust and flexible, compatible with all javascript-enabled frameworks. It aims to be non-intrusive on your IDE/application while having an easy to read and understand syntax. It is influenced by many other JavaScript unit testing frameworks.


# Installation

_Jasmine for Node.js_

Add Jasmine to your package.json


```
npm install --save-dev jasmine
```


Initialize Jasmine in your project


```
npx jasmine init
```


Set jasmine as your test script in your package.json


```
"scripts": { "test": "jasmine" }
```


Run your tests


```
npm test
```


_Jasmine can also be installed as a standalone._

_Visit [this link](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html) to learn more about other installations._


# Setup


## Initialize a Project

Initialize a project for Jasmine by creating a spec directory and configuration json for you.


```
jasmine init
```


Note that if you installed Jasmine locally use npx jasmine instead of jasmine in any of these examples, like so:


```
npx jasmine init
```


Generate example spec and source files


```
jasmine examples
```


At this point you should be able to[ write your first suite](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite.html)<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span>


## Configuration

Customize spec/support/jasmine.json to enumerate the source files and spec files you would like the Jasmine runner to include. You may use dir glob strings.

Paths starting with ! are excluded, for example !**/*nospec.js.

spec_dir is used as a prefix for all spec_files and helpers. Helpers are executed before specs. For an example of some helpers see the[ react tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/react_with_npm)


```
{
  // Spec directory path relative to the current working dir when jasmine is executed.
  "spec_dir": "spec",

  // Array of filepaths (and globs) relative to spec_dir to include and exclude
  "spec_files": [
    "**/*[sS]pec.js",
    "!**/*nospec.js"
  ],

  // Array of filepaths (and globs) relative to spec_dir to include before jasmine specs
  "helpers": [
    "helpers/**/*.js"
  ],

  // Stop execution of a spec after the first expectation failure in it
  "stopSpecOnExpectationFailure": false,

  // Run specs in semi-random order
  "random": false
}
```
